<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction to ORAM</h2>

**What is Oblivious RAM**

Oblivious RAM (ORAM) provides a secret database that 'encrypts' not only the data contents, but also the <b> accesses </b> to data.

**Application of ORAM**

The Path ORAM algorithm, co-invented
by our co-founder, 
is in use by the [Signal encrypted messenger](https://signal.org/blog/building-faster-oram/) for private contact discovery. 
<br>

ORAM can also be used in blockchains to enable private order flow and mitigate Miner Extractable Value (MEV).
